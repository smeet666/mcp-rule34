# Releasing

Releases are published to npm by GitHub Actions using npm **trusted publishing**
(OIDC). There is no npm token stored on this repository.

## One-time setup

Trusted publishing is configured from a package's settings page, so it cannot be
used for the very first publish of a package that does not exist yet. The first
release goes out from a workstation; everything after that goes out from CI.

### 1. Publish the first version manually

```bash
npm login                    # interactive, asks for the 2FA code
npm publish --access public  # prepublishOnly reruns typecheck, tests and build
```

### 2. Register the trusted publisher

On npmjs.com, open the package, then **Settings** and the **Trusted Publisher**
section. Every field is case-sensitive and must match this repository exactly:

| Field                | Value          |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Publisher            | GitHub Actions |
| Organization or user | `smeet666`     |
| Repository           | `mcp-rule34`   |
| Workflow filename    | `publish.yml`  |
| Environment          | leave empty    |
| Allowed actions      | `npm publish`  |

### 3. Lock out token publishing (optional, recommended)

In the same settings page, restrict publishing to trusted publishers only. From
then on a leaked npm token cannot push a release of this package.

## Every release after that

1. Bump the version in **four** places, which must stay in step:
   - `package.json`
   - `server.json` (twice: the top-level `version` and the package `version`)
   - `packaging/manifest.json`, which the `.mcpb` bundle announces itself with
   - `src/version.ts`, which feeds the User-Agent and the name the server
     answers `initialize` with
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit, then tag and push:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main --tags
```

The `publish.yml` workflow reruns typecheck, tests and build, then publishes with
`--provenance`, which links the published tarball to the exact commit and workflow
run that produced it.

## Verifying a release

```bash
npm view mcp-rule34 version
npx -y mcp-rule34          # should start and wait on stdin
```

The npm package page should show a provenance badge pointing at the workflow run.

Note that publishing is permanent: a version can only be unpublished within 72
hours, and the name stays reserved afterwards.

## Listing on the MCP registry

`server.json` at the repository root is ready for the official MCP registry. Once
the package is on npm, publish the listing with the `mcp-publisher` CLI, which
authenticates against GitHub and matches the `mcpName` field in `package.json`
against the repository to prove ownership.
